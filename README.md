In this project, we leverage Pandas to ingest data from a CSV file, facilitating efficient manipulation and analysis.
Beginning with data loading via Pandas' read_csv() function, we ensure seamless integration of the CSV's content into a DataFrame. Subsequently, a series of manipulations unfold: from basic transformations to give the data shape and creating visualizations.
